### Welcome!

This framework represents the outcome of over a decade of research, beginning with baseline analysis of biodiversity
data in the region of the Salish Sea.

Explore the map to access several baseline datasets and projects that exemplify our efforts to understand
biodiversity change following a novel protocol for biodiversity assessment that communities can
harness to conduct similar studies. Check out the documentation behind our methodology here.
