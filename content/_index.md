## Bryophytes of the Pacific Northwest

Some AI-generated slop:

The Pacific Northwest is home to one of the richest and most diverse assemblages of bryophytes in North America.
From the dripping rainforests of the Olympic Peninsula to the alpine meadows of the Cascades, mosses, liverworts, and
hornworts form a vibrant and often overlooked layer of the region’s ecosystems. These small, non-vascular plants thrive
in the cool, moist conditions that dominate much of the coastal and montane environments, carpeting rocks, soil, and
tree trunks with intricate textures and subtle colors. Their presence not only enhances the beauty of the landscape but
also plays an essential role in maintaining ecological balance.

This guide brings together the three major lineages of bryophytes—Bryophyta (mosses), Marchantiophyta (liverworts), and
Anthocerotophyta (hornworts)—to provide a comprehensive introduction to their identification, diversity, and natural
history in the Pacific Northwest. By highlighting key features, habitats, and distribution, it aims to equip
naturalists, students, and field botanists with the tools to appreciate and recognize these fascinating plants. Whether
encountered on a shaded forest floor, clinging to windswept cliffs, or colonizing freshly exposed soil, bryophytes are a
constant and resilient presence, offering insight into both the ancient origins of land plants and the delicate dynamics
of present-day ecosystems.

This guide is an early work in progress with much content remaining to be added. However, here is a selection of
taxa for which the content is relatively complete:

[Douinia ovata](</taxa/Douinia ovata>)\
[Calypogeia muelleriana](</taxa/Calypogeia muelleriana>)\
[Cephalozia bicuspidata](</taxa/Cephalozia bicuspidata>)

This site is built with a radical and innovative design where the information content is sourced from a Google
Sheets spreadsheet, with high resolution source images in Google Drive. This allows subject matter experts to take control
over their content without gatekeeping by technologists and content management platforms. The site build can be run
from within R studio using the [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) package, a wrapper for the [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) site generator. The source
spreadsheet can be seen at [BC_Bryo_Database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MG7C7GX1Tl2RO_vHuMwUo8quhzYZd_mElWRnPuNbpj8/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
