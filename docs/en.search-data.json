Shoots stand erect to 5 cm tall bearing golden yellow-green leaves that are distantly spaced, wider than long and with slightly asymmetrical lobes that are blunt at their tips. Underleaves are absent and under the microscope, gemmae are angular and two-celled.\nSimilar species The erect stature, red gemmae and broad, two-lobed leaves set Anastrepta orcadensis apart from almost all other regional leafy liverwort species. Species of Tritomaria have red gemmae but are three-lobed. Red-gemmaed species of Lophozia grow horizontally, not erect as in A. orcadensis.\nHabitat Moist to wet humus, rock outcrops, ledges, cliffs, depressions, seepage sites, bogs, waterfall spray zones, streambanks, and tundra in the lowland, montane, and subalpine zones; infrequent of open coast of BC [Haida Gwaii, north coast].\nAssociated species Macrodiplophylum plicatum, Scapania bolanderi, Rhytidiadelphus loreus, Metzgeria leptoneura\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: December 28, 2025 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

The distantly-spaced leaves are attached obliquely along the stem and have symmetrical lobes that are seperated by a sinus that descends down to about 1/2 the leaf’s length or less. Like most members of its genus, A. assimile has leaves that tend to orient themselves to one side of the shoot (“secund”).\nSimilar species Species of Marsupella can grow in the same habitat and show the same dark colours on equally two-lobed leaves, but in n that genus, the leaves are attached across the stem and point upwards, while in A. assimilei, the leaves are attached obliquely (at least on the back of the stem) and point to one side of the stem.

Leafy shoots are up to 10 cm long and 4 mm wide, the leaves appearing as though attached across the width of the stem. Close inspection with a hand lens shows leaf tissues running down the length of the stem on the upper surface (“decurrent”) and attaching at a slightly oblique angle on the lower surface. Underleaves and gemmae are absent and the concave leaves have a tendency to orient themselves to one side of the stem (“secund”).\nSimilar species No other regional species of Anastrophyllum has such shallowly lobed leaves. Barbilophozia kunzeana can grow in the same habitats and has short lobes, but underleaves are present in that species and absent in Anastrophyllum donnianum.\nHabitat Moist to wet humus, rock outcrops, cliffs, seepage sites, bogs, fens, heath, and tundra in the lowland, montane, subalpine, and alpine zones; infrequent in coastal BC [Haida Gwaii, north coast].\nAssociated species XXXXXX\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Dec 30, 2025 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

A plant of wet, northern parts of the Pacific Northwest, it has carpet-forming shoots up to 5 cm long and 2 mm wide, the leaves with two equal lobes seperated by a sinus that descends up to one-half of the leaf’s length . Underleaves are absent, gemmae are occasionally present and sporophytes are unknown in the region.

The thallus can grow between 2-5 cm long and 2-6 mm wide, having a characteristic greasy texture when its fresh tissues are rubbed. The thallus, though thickest in the center (10-to-20 cells thick), lacks an obvious midrib and tapers gradually towards its margins (1-to-3 cells thick). Under the microscope, oil bodies are colourless and abundant (6-to-20 per cell). The male and female plants are seperate; sporophytes, when present, emerge from the underside of the plant.\nSimilar species Because of its amorphous and thick thallus, A. pinguis could be mistaken for many other bryophytes. It has a thallus not dissimilair to the hornworts Anthoceros and Phaeoceros, but those two genera have thalli that form brached rosettes and bear pyrenoids in their cells, large photosynthetic apparati that are absent in the mostly linear thalli of Aneura. Species of Pellia are similar in form, but have a more pronounced midrib and lack the turpentine smell of fresh Aneura. It should also be noted that sporophytes are produced along the upper surface in the former but emerge from the underside of the thallus in the latter. Species or Riccardia are narrower (thallus segments \u003c 2 mm wide) and their surficial cells have fewer oil bodies.\nHabitat Moist to wet mineral soil, humus, bogs, fens, swamps, peatlands, streambanks, shorelines, decayed logs, seepage areas, cliffs, boulders, rock outcrops, ledges, waterfall spray zones, and disturbed areas in the lowland, montane, and subalpine zones;\nAssociated species Sphagnum sp.\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Dec 12, 2025 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

It is a white-speckled plant that seemingly straddles the boundary between leafy and thalloid liverwort on account of thick, succulent leaves. The leaves themselves are of two sizes, both broadly and irregularly ovate, that seem to emerge from a common thallus-like tissue. The prominent white oil bodies can be seen at the surface with the naked eye and are diagnostic for this species in the region.\nSimilar species The leafy liverworts Schistochilopsis incisa, Heterogemma laxa and species of Fossombronia can all exhibit irregular leaves that ride the boundary between thallus and leaf, but none of those species have the white, macroscopic oil bodies that are visible along the surface of A. nana.\nHabitat Moist to wet humus, rock outcrops, cliffs, bogs (among sedges in drainages), and occasionally decayed wood in the lowland zone in hypermaritime regions along the open coast.\nAssociated species Sphagnum sp., Scapania uliginosa, Mastigophora woodsii, Herbertus sp., Pleruozia purpurea, Dicranum undulatum, Hookeria lucens\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Dec 13, 2025 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

Solenostoma, Jungermannia) have unlobed lateral leaves that can give off the appearance of being arranged oppositely, but close inspection of the leaf bases shows that they are arranged alternately. Of these genera, only species of Nardia and Odontoschisma have underleaves as in Arnellia fennica, but neither of those genera have their lateral leaves fused at their base along the upper surface of the stem.\nHabitat Associated species Distribution Map Authors: Last updated: Dec 13, 2025 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

Close inspection with a hand lens reveals no underleaves, which in combination with the 2-to-3 shallow lobes with dull tips makes this unique among regional species in its genus. Brownish, angular and two-celled gemmae are often present at the lobe tips.\nSimilar species The obliquely to subtransversely-inserted bilobed leaves put B. sudetica in league with a number of species of Lophozia, a genus into which it has been frequently lumped. Species of Lophozia (and Lophoziopsis) lack the reddish pigmentation and those that occur in the same subalpine habitats (L. wenzelii, Lophozia ventricosa) tend to dwell on organic substrates and/or bear green gemmae. B. sudetica has brown gemmae and grows amongst rocks. Harpanthus flotovianus and species of Mesoptychia can be similair in size and leaf form but again lack the reddish pigmentation and also possess underleaves that are absent in B. sudetica. Schljakovia kunzeana has very similair pigmentation to B. sudetica and inhabits the same montane rocky substrates, but it also has prominent underleaves that are visible with a hand lens.\nHabitat Moist to wet, often shady humus, rock outcrops, boulders, cliffs, streambanks, waterfall spray zones, seepage sites, heath, and tundra in the upper montane, subalpine, and alpine zones\nAssociated species XXXXXX\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: December 7, 2025 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

The arched lateral leaves have three very shallow tooth-like lobes (\u003c1/10th leaf length) at their tips, while the underleaves are wider than long with 3-4 lobes with rounded tips. The naked shoot sections stand out in particular, especially on plants found in extensive carpets on conifer trunks, stumps and logs.\nSimilar species The evenly-forked shoots and notch-like lobes at the tip of the lateral leaves make it unlike any species outside its own genus, though Calypogiea species are often found in the same habitat and can mimic the leaf form. Bazzania denudata has 3-4 lobes on its underleaf, however, while species of Calypogeia have 2 at most. B. tricrenata and B. griffithiana are brown-to-yellow species with significantly longer shoots (\u003e3 cm). Bazzania trilobata is emerald green like B. denudata, but the shoots are much wider (3-6 mm vs. 2 mm) and its underleaves have toothed crests, not rounded ones. B. pearsonii, a species of similar size and colour to B. denudata, has unlobed underleaves. Bazzania ambigua typically shows 2-lobed lateral leaves and underleaves that are as long as wide, while B. denudata has (typically) 3-lobed lateral leaves and underleaves that are wider than long. If uncertain, check the lateral leaves with a microscope: oil bodies are 8-12 in B. denudata and 2-4 in B. ambigua.\nHabitat Moist to wet, often shady rock outcrops, cliffs, ledges, boulders, humus, mineral soil, and decayed wood in the lowland and montane zones\nAssociated species Lepidozia reptans, Scapania bolanderi, Rhizomnium glabrescens, and many others\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Dec 13, 2025 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

The leaves are formed of 2-3 linear segments that are divided all the way to the base of the leaf. Close inspection shows that these linear segments are one cell wide and in turn tend to branch.\nSimilar species See notes under Blepharostoma trichophyllum.\nHabitat Moist to wet mineral soil, cliffs, rock outcrops, swamps, streambanks, decayed wood, and waterfall spray zones, occasionally submerged in shallow water, in the lowland zone\nAssociated species XXXXXX\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: June 17, 2025 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

With a hand lends the leaves are composed of four equal and linear lobes that are seperated all the way to the very base of the leaf. Under the microscope, these lobes are only one cell wide.\nSimilar species Species of Kurzia are of similair size with 4-lobed leaves and can occur in similair habitats. The leave lobes in that genus, however, are 1-celled at their tip but broaden to 2 (or more) cells wide towards their base, which is found at about three-quarters down the leaf’s length. In B. trichophylla, the leaf lobes are always 1 cell wide and are divided all the way to the very base of the left. Differences with Blepharostoma arachnoideum are subtle– the latter tending to have 2-3 lobes that often branch further along their length, while in B. trichophyllum, there are typically 4 (sometimes 3) lobes that are never branched. B. trichophylla is often treated as a complex of closely related taxa with intergrading morphologies.\nHabitat Moist to wet, usually shady humus, rock outcrops, boulders, cliffs, ledges, decayed wood, streambanks, and waterfall spray zones in the lowland, montane, and subalpine zones\nAssociated species XXXXXX\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Nov 13, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

Typically tightly appressed to decaying conifers and organic-rich soils, this species can be confirmed by hand lens examination of the underleaf, which should show two lobes that are divided to about half of their length. Like many species in the genus, C. muelleriana frequently has gemmae-bearing shoots that have more distant leaves and erect shoot apices with light-green clusters of asexual spores.\nSimilar species Calypogeia muelleriana is unlikely to be confused with any other genus of leafy liverworts with the exception of Bazzania, which can show similair shingle-like arrangement of leaves. That genus, however, has leaves that have tooth-like notches at the tips and underleaves with more than two lobes. The green, rounded leaves and evenly two-lobed underleaves of C. muelleriana are similair to many species in the genus Calypogeia, but can be distinguished from other species with a hand lens. Plants of C. azurea have identical leaves and underleaves, but have a blue hue, while C. sphagnicola has leaves that are triangular in shape and do not overlap, whereas leaves in C. muelleriana are round and tightly overlap. C. integristipula and C. neesiana have unlobed underleaves and C. fissa has an underleaf dissected almost all the way to its base, while the underleaf in C. muelleriana is only dissected to about half of its length. C. suecica, a rare species of wet wood, is very small (typically \u003c1 mm wide) and has somewhat pointed underleaves relative to the rounded underleaves of C. muelleriana, which occur on shoots typically \u003e2 mm wide.\nHabitat Decaying wood and organic rich soil banks in forests\nAssociated species Lepidozia reptans, Bazzania denudata, Tetraphis pellucidam Pseudotaxiphyllum elegans\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: June 17, 2025 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

It is an infrequent species of moist environments where it tends to creep on peaty banks and decaying organic matter. As with all species in this genus, the proof is in the pudding . . . your fingers on the shoots and turning them over so that you can examine the underleaves with a hand lens. These underleaves are unlobed, which in combination with the triangular and frequently notched lateral leaves proves diagnostic for this species.\nSimilar species Radula and Bazzania can have ovate-triangular leaves that overlap like wooden shingles, but species of Radula lack an underleaf and the underleaf in green species of Bazzania has 3 or 4 shallow lobes on it as opposed to the entire underleaf in C. neesiana. Within its own genus, it is only mistakeable for C. integrispula, as all other species have a well developed sinus dividing the lobes on the underleaf.

Underleaves are divided to about half of their length and show somewhat narrow lobe tips.\nSimilar species Quite a few small leafy liverworts make their home in Sphagnum, however species of Gymnocolea, Cephalozia and Cephaloziella all have leaves that are deeply two-lobed, whereas those of C. sphagnicola are very shallowly-lobed if at all. Both Mylia taylorii and M. anomala can grow between Sphagnum, but both species have large (\u003e2mm) oval-shaped leaves that point upwards, whereas those of C. sphagnicola are small (\u003c1mm), rounded-triangular and tend to point out at 90 degrees from the stem. In the genus Calypogeia, only C. integrispula and C. fissa are likely to occur in the same habitat, but both of those species are larger (shoots ~2mm wide) and have distinct underleaves (unlobed in C. integrispula, deeply lobed in C. fissa) that differ from the halfway-lobed form of C. sphagnicola.\nHabitat Sphagnum\nAssociated species XXXXXX\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: June 17, 2025 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

Close inspection with a hand lens should reveal an underleaf that is dissected to about half of its length and crowned by 2 or 4 somewhat sharp apices.\nSimilar species On decaying wood, C. suecica is most likely to be mistaken for C. muelleriana and C. azurea, both of which are bigger species with identical leaf arrangement on the tops of the shoot. C. azurea is easy to distinguish on account of its blue hue, but smaller plants of C. muelleriana will look very similar and may need microscopic examination to detect subtle differences in underleaf shape (more acute in C. suecica) and oil body form (segmented oil bodies are known in both species, but only C. suecica has them alongside simple oil bodies).\nHabitat Decaying wood\nAssociated species XXXXXX\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: November 4, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

Inspection with a hand lens shows two rows of sharply bilobed leaves, the leaves themselves slightly wider than the stem and attaching at their bases nearly at a right angle across the stem and very close to its midline. Sporophytes are frequently present and can be found developing in or extruding from elongate, ridged, whitish-green and erect pouches.\nSimilar species This species frequently coocurs with a number of lookalikes. Lepidozia reptans is of similar size, colour and habitat, but has clearly 3-4 lobed leaves, whereas C. bicuspidata leaves are 2-lobed. Species of Cephaloziella are typically a little smaller, but can be clearly seperated out by leaves narrower than the shoot as opposed C. bicuspidata, where the leaves are wider than the shoot. Species in the genus Fuscocephaloziopsis are similar in scale, habitat and the presence of bilobed leaves, but those leaves are attached along the length of the stem, whereas in C. bicuspidata, the leaves are attached obliquely across the stem. Cephalozia ambigua is treated often as a subspecies of C. bicuspidata, the former differing in its smaller size (~ .5 mm wide) and the presence of underleaves which are absent in the latter. C. macounii is somehow much smaller (« .5 mm wide) very similar, but microscope inspection of the leaf should show very oblique attachment to the stem, whereas in C. bicuspidata leaves verge on attaching at a right angle across the stem axis.\nHabitat Decaying wood and peat\nAssociated species Lepizodia reptans, Tetraphis pellucida, Rhizomnium glabrescens, Riccardia latifrons\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: November 5, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

The vegetative leaves are smaller than the shoot diameter and are sharply two-lobed to about 1/2 or 3/4 leave length and fairly smooth along their edges. Microscopic examination should be used to confirm this latter character as well as the presence of oil bodies.\nSimilar species Sphenolobopsis, Marsupella, Cephalozia and Fuscocephaloziopsis can be of similair size and leaf form, but the leaves in those genera are wider than the stems and have oil bodies, while in C. divaricata oil bodies are lacking and the leaves are narrower than the stem. Eremonotus myriocarpus is very similar in size, leaf shape and threadlike growth habit. It grows in the very specific habitat of damp vertical rock, but otherwise requires granular examination of the shoots to compare leaf shapes and reproductive structures- see photos under that species. Other species of Cephaloziella (C. phyllacantha, C. spinigera, C. turneri, C. elachista) in this region have leaves divided almost to their bases in addition to prominent teeth along the leaf margins. Vegetative leaves of C. divaricata are divided to about half their length and typically without teeth. The remaining species will need to be parsed based on the arrngement of their reproductive organs. In Cephaloziella divaricata, the modified leafy structures that bear the archegonia (“gynoecia”) and antheridia (“androecia”), while in C. rubellum, C. varians and C. hampeana, they can be found on the same shoots.\nHabitat Dry to wet humus, mineral soil, decayed wood, rock outcrops, boulders, cliffs, ledges, crevices, streambanks, waterfall spray zones, bogs, disturbed areas, and occasionally tree trunks in the lowland, steppe, montane, and subalpine zones; common in coastal BC, infrequent in sc BC, rare in se and n BC.\nAssociated species XXXXXX\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Nov 6, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

Maybe with a hand lens but more likely with a microscope, you will see deeply divided 2-lobed leaves with sharp apices and tooth-like projections arising from their base. Under the microscope, the lobes themselves are 2-4 cells wide at their base, with teeth restricted to that lower margin and thin leaf cell walls.\nSimilar species At the small scale and specialized habitat that C. elachista grows in, only species of Cephalozia, Fuscocephaloziopsis and Cephaloziella could be confused. The first two genera are typically “bigger” plants, with leafy shoots measuring \u003e.5 mm wide and the leaves themselves visibly wider than said shoots. Leafy shoots of C. elachista are ~1/4 mm wide and the leaves themselves narrower than the shoots. Cephaloziella divaricata can grow in the same habitat, but its leaves are only divided to half their length, while those of C. elachista are divided almost to their base. C. spinigera also occurs in the same habitat and is impossible to distinguish without a microscope– its leaf cells are wider (9-12 um) and its cell walls thinner than those of C. elachista (see photo).\nHabitat Sphagnum bogs in the montane zone; rare in se BC\nAssociated species XXXXXX\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Nov 6, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

Under the land lens, the unornamented spreading leaves are lobed with a sinus descending to around half the leaf length. To distinguish this species from others in the genus, care must be taken to confirm the absence of underleaves as well as for gynoecia and androecia, which should be present on different branches of the same plant.\nSimilar species At its size (leafy shoots less than .5 mm wide) with distantly spaced bilobed leaves, it could only be mistaken for other members within the genus Cephaloziella. C. turneri, C. spinigera, C. phyllacantha and C elachista all have leaves are dissected very near to their toothy or spurred bases, while C. hampeana has lobed, toothless leaves divided to only about half of their length. C. divaricata has underleaves on the shoots and androecia and gynoecia on seperate plants; underleaves are absent on C. hampeana and its gynoecia and androecia are on the same plant. C. varians has round lobe tips on erect leaves where those of C. hampeana are acute on wide-spreading leaves. C. rubella, the last species that it could be confused for in the region, has erect leaves and androecia and gynoecia close together on the same shoot in contrast to their arrangement on seperate branches in C. hampeana, which has wide-spreading leaves.\nHabitat Moist to mesic, often shady humus, mineral soil, decayed wood, rock outcrops, boulders, and streambanks in the montane zone; rare in se BC.\nAssociated species XXXXXX\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Nov 6, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

The deeply lobed leaves (to within a few cells of their base) are flamboyantly toothed, with tall conical papillae over many of the leaf cells (see image) that are unique to this species.\nSimilar species Cephaloziella turneri, C. elachista and C. spinigera all have deeply divided leaves with somewhat prominent teeth, as in C. phyllacantha. All of these similar species lack the conical papillae under the microscope. Its also useful to know that they grow in very different habitats- C. turneri in seasonally hot and dry areas, while both C. elachista and C. spinigera are “Sphagnicolous”, growing between the shoots of Sphagnum in bogs and fens.\nHabitat Moist to wet, shady humus, cliffs, crevices, and boulders in the lowland zone and montane (rare) zones; rare in sw and ec [Rocky Mts.] BC.\nAssociated species XXXXXX\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Nov 6, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

Maybe with a hand lens but more likely with a microscope, you will see deeply divided 2-lobed leaves with sharp apices and tooth-like projections arising from their base. Under the microscope, the lobes themselves are 2-4 cells wide at their base, with teeth restricted to that lower margin and thick leaf cell walls.\nSimilar species At the small scale and specialized habitat that C. spinigera grows in, only species of Cephalozia, Fuscocephaloziopsis and Cephaloziella could be confused. The first two genera are typically “bigger” plants, with leafy shoots measuring \u003e.5 mm wide and the leaves themselves visibly wider than said shoots. Leafy shoots of C. spinigera are ~1/4 mm wide and the leaves themselves narrower than the shoots. Cephaloziella divaricata can grow in the same habitat, but its leaves are only divided to half their length, while those of C. spinigera are divided almost to their base. C. elachista also occurs in the same habitat and is impossible to distinguish without a microscope– its leaf cells are narrower (\u003c 9 um) and its cell walls thicker than those of C. spinigera (see photo).\nHabitat Exposed peat, Sphagnum, and other mosses in wetlands in the upper montane and subalpine zones; rare in nw BC [Boundary Ranges].\nAssociated species XXXXXX\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Nov 6, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

It thrives on fine mineral soils, especially along rock ledges or under overhangs. Antheridia and archegonia are borne on separate plants (dioicous) and the openings on the upper surface of the thallus are star-shaped.\nSimilar species White scales that protrude along the margins of a thallose liverwort are not seen in many species. Species in the genus Riccia can have white scales along the margin, but plants of that genus have a prominent furrow down the middle of the thallus and sporophytes that are embedded in the thallus. In Clevea, the thallus is not furrowed and the sporophytes are borne on a specialized carpocephalum that emerges from and sits well above the thallus. Mannia fragrans can grow in similar habitats and the tips of its scales can be white, but they show purple pigmentation near their base. Furthermore, that species has a hemispherical carpocephalum, antheridia that are cloistered together on a differentiated pad and an upper surface with air chamber openings that are encircled by two rings of surface cells. In Clevea, the openings of the air chambers on the upper surface are star-shaped and lack encircling rings of cells, antheridia are scattered along the thallus and the carpocephalum has distinct segments. The two other genera of Cleveaceae known to occur in the Pacific Northwest are both arctic-alpine in distribution and both can have white scales. Sauteria alpina differs in having antheridia and archegonia present on the same plant (“monoicous”) and a rounded carpocephalum compared to the clearly lobed carpocephalum of Clevea hyalina, a species that has its antheridia on separate plants from said carpocephalum. Peltolepis quadrata has a carpocephalum that emerges from a notch at the edge of the thallus and bears 3-8 lobes, whereas the carpocephalum of C. hyalina emerges from the middle of the thallus and has 2-4 lobes. Antheridia, when present, are diffuse on the thallus of Clevea, while in P. quadrata, they are cloistered into a small pad.\nHabitat Moist, shady mineral soil, rock outcrops, and cliffs, often where calcareous, in the lowland, montane, and subalpine zones; infrequent in sw and n [east to the Rocky Mts.] BC, rare in sc, c, and se BC.\nAssociated species Distribution Map Authors: Last updated: Dec 4, 2025 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

C. macounii can be recognized by its oblong leaf lobes, leaf cells with large papillae, and by its toothed lobule margin. Previously thought to be rare, before 2023 was only known from five or six locations. Since 2023 recent surveys uncovered new records of the species on the Central Coast and Vancouver Island. It is likely C. macounii is more common than previously thought but has remained elusive due to its extremely small size and specific habitat requirements.\nSimilar species Cololejeunea macounii is most commonly confused with Radula bolanderi or other species of Radula which are similar sized and also grow as epiphytes. Microscopically Cololejeunea can be easily disinguished by all species of Radula by its toothed apical lobule margin, and large leaf cell papillae. In the field, Radula bolanderi is often found growing in the same habitat as Cololejeunea, but the latter can be recognized by the more oblong leaf lobes and pale yellowish green colour, compared to the rounder leaves and fresher green colour of R. bolanderi. As well, the leaf arrangment of C. macounii is more disorganized compared to R. bolanderi which often has leaves cleanly alternating.\nHabitat Consitently humid microsites in hypermaritime rainforests. Often found growing on Ribes sp. Rubus spectabilis, or Oplopanax horridus stems along streams or in spray zones. Ocasionally found as an epiphyll on Tsuga or Abies needles, or on Alnus rubra logs.\nAssociated species Radula bolanderi, Metzgeria temperata, Ulota spp.\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Dec 13, 2025 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

The leafy shoots are less than 1/4 of a millimeter wide and between 2 and 8 mm long. They bear sharply and symmetrically bilobed leaves with a sinus that descends down to about half of the leaf’s length. Underleaves and gemmae are absent.

The slightly larger Hygrobiella laxa is identical in leaf shape and insertion, but its leaves are green and transluscent, not dark and opaque as in Eremonotus. The rock-dwelling species of Cephaloziella are pale green and whitish, with the exception of some forms of C. divaricata, which has leaves that are narrow than the stem. In E. myriocarpus, the leaves are wide than the stem.\nHabitat Moist to wet mineral soil, rock outcrops, cliffs, ledges, crevices, boulders, streambanks, and tundra in the lowland (rare), montane, subalpine, and alpine zones\nAssociated species Blepharostoma trichophyllum, Blindia acuta, Anthelia sp.\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Jun 17, 2025 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

From above, the plant is composed of tightly overlapping, round upper lobes on their leaves. Looked at from below with a hand lens, you should be able to make out the upper leaf lobes coming to a sharp point at their apex and the small, helmet-shaped “lobule” that rests underneath it.\nSimilar species Sometimes this can be mistaken for species of Porella, but in that genus, the little helmet-shaped “lobule” present in Frullania is absent. Likewise, Radula can also grow as a small epiphyte growing close to the bark, but in that genus, there is no “lobule”, nor is there the prominent underleaf found in species of Frullania. F. nisquallensis is the “largest” species in the genus, but could be mistaken for similar epiphytic forms of F. californica and rock-dwelling Frullania franciscana.

Up close, the leaves are symmetrically bilobed with sharp apices and a sinus that descends between 1/3 and 1/2 leaf length and lobe tips that do not converge. At their base, the leaves are attached obliquely along the length of the stem. Underleaves and gemmae are absent. To confidently identify this species, microscopic examination is neccessary to see (1) the slightly decurrent leaf bases and (2) the small leaf cells at the base of the lobes (around 20 um in maximum dimension).\nSimilar species The obliquely attached symmetrically bilobed leaves that are larger than the shoot puts it safely in league with other species of Cephaloziaceae. The barely decurrent leaf base make it most comparable to other species of Fuscocephaloziopsis. F. connivens and F. lunulifolia have lobe tips that converge, cross or point towards one another unlike the lobe tips in F. catenulata which are mostly parallel. F. pleniceps is similair but has leaves that are attached mostly along the length of the stem and not so clearly oblique as in F. catenulata.\nHabitat Decayed wood in the montane and subalpine zones; rare in southwest [Vancouver Island] and northwest [Boundary Ranges] British Columbia.\nAssociated species XXXXXX\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: November 5, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

Paired with leaf attachment along the length of the stem and a lower leaf base that runs down the stem, F. connivens is unmistakable.\nSimilar species Likely to be confused only with F. lunulifolia and F. pleniceps, both of which are species that also feature round, two-lobed leaves with acute tips that are attached along the length of the stem such that their lower bases run down the shoot. Neither of these species, however, have tips that converge with one another as they do in F. connivens.\nHabitat Moist to mesic humus, decayed wood, and bogs in the lowland and montane zones; rare in coastal and southeast British Columbia.\nAssociated species XXXXXX\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: November 5, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

The symmetrically bilobes leaves are longer than wide with a deep sinus that descends more than 1/2 of the leaf’s length, with loe tips that are parallel (not convergent). Leaves are distantly spaced and attached just a little obliquely across the width of the stem. With a microscope or strong hand lens the leaves can be seen in more detail, revealing the lobes as only 4 cells wide, their tips two cells long by one cell wide and leaf cells that lack oil bodies.\nSimilar species The lack of oil bodies and leaves wider than the stem distinguish C. leucantha from species of Cephaloziella, which have leaves narrower than the stem and leaf cells with oil bodies. If their peaty habitat, likely only to be confused with other species of Cephalozia and Fuscocephaloziopsis. Amongst these, only C. bicuspidata and C. macounii have leaves attached mostly across the width of the stem as they are in F. leucantha. In all other species of Fuscocephaloziopsis, the leaves are attached mostly along the length of the stem.\nHabitat Moist to mesic humus, cliffs, and bogs in the lowland and montane zones; rare in coastal, southeast, and northern British Columbia.\nAssociated species XXXXXX\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: November 5, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

Close inspection show a two-lobed leaf with sharp apices that is divided to about 1/3 its length and attached along the long axis of the stem such that its base runs down along the shoot (“decurrent”). The outward-pointing apices are an unreliable indication of this species, so microscopic examination is required to see the thickened outer wall of the cell at the lobe tip and the decreasing cell size in the leaf from base to sinus.\nSimilar species Likely to be confused only with F. connivens and F. pleniceps, both of which are species that also feature round, two-lobed leaves with acute tips that are attached along the length of the stem such that their lower bases run down the shoot. F.connivens has lobe tips that tend to point towards if not touch or cross one another, while in F. lunulifolia, the lobe tips are not so convergent. F. lunulifolia is very similar to F. pleniceps, but under the microscope it has outer walls of the terminal lobe cells much thicker than the inner wall, whilst in the latter the wall is evenly thickened all around.\nHabitat Moist to mesic, often shady humus, decayed wood, shorelines, streambanks, bogs, and occasionally tree bases in the lowland, montane, and subalpine zones; locally frequent in southwest BC, infrequent elsewhere in coastal BC and in southeast BC, rare in north, central and north-central BC.\nAssociated species XXXXXX\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: November 5, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

Upclose, it has a succulent stem, leaves that are shallowly two-lobed or occasionally even three-lobed and underleaves can be present, though they are typically obscured by a dense set of hairs (“rhizoids”). Under the microscope, this species lacks oil bodies and can exhibit green, two-celled gemmae produced along young leaf tips at the shoot apex.\nSimilar species On account of its large size and very compressed shoots, it is unlikely to be mistaken for any other member of Cephaloziaceae. In its habitat, however, it can coocur with species of Lophozia and Tritomaria that are superficially similair. Neither of these genera exhibit the dark green colour and deeply, symmetrically compressed shoots of F. monticola.\nHabitat Moist to wet humus, seepage sites, streambanks, pool margins, snowbed sites, heath, and tundra in the subalpine and alpine zones; infrequent in southwest BC, rare elsewhere in coastal BC.\nAssociated species XXXXXX\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: November 5, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

Hand lens inspection of the leaf should show them attached along the length of stem, with the bottom edge running down the shoot (“decurrent”) and the lobe tips sharp before descending into a rounded sinus. Confident identification requires microscopy to count the number of cells across the leafs’ width (12-25) and note the even thickness of terminal lobe cells.\nSimilar species Species of Cephaloziella can occur in peaty habitats, but they have leaves narrower than the stems they are borne on, whilst in F. pleniceps, the leaves are wider than the stems. In the family Cephaloziaceae, only F. connivens and F. lunulifolia exhibit leaves that attach down the length of the stem as in F. pleniceps. F. connivens tends to have lobe tips that converge on one another like a crab’s pincher, whereas those of F. pleniceps seldomly converge and tend to point upwards. F. lunulifolia is very similar to F. pleniceps, but under the microscope it has outer walls of the terminal lobe cells much thicker than the inner wall, whilst in the latter the wall is evenly thickened all around.\nHabitat Moist to wet humus, streambanks, and bogs in the montane zone; infrequent in southeast BC, rare in coastal, south-central, and northeast [Kotcho Lake] BC.\nAssociated species XXXXXX\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Nov 6, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

The lateral leaves are shallowly-lobed (less than 1/4 the leaf’s length), their tips sharp but triangular, while the underleaves are clearly visible with a hand lens and are also clearly two-lobed. When sporophytes are present, they emerge anomalously along the underside of the shoot.\nSimilar species Most likely to be confused with species of Lophozia, Mesoptychia and Lophocolea, all of which can show variations of shallowly but acutely two-lobed leaves inserted along the length of the stem. Species of Lophozia lack the underleaves of Geocalyx. Underleaves are present but obscure in Mesoptychia and when visible are simple and narrow, not two-pronged and visible with a hand lens as in Geocalyx. Lophocolea bidentata has nearly identical underleaves, but in that species, the lobe apices are very fine and long, while those of Geocalyx are triangular and truncate.\nHabitat Moist to mesic, usually shady humus, mineral soil, decayed wood, tree trunks, rock outcrops, ledges, crevices, cliffs, and streambanks in the lowland and montane zones alpine zones\nAssociated species XXXXXX\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Nov 12, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

The tiny dark-green leafy shoots are about ½ mm wide and up to 2 cm long, the leaves themselves distantly spaced, inserted across the stem and bilobed with a sinus descending to about ⅓ of the leaf’s length. Underleaves are present and often hard to distinguish from lateral leaves. This is an infrequent species, found on rocks along creeks and waterfalls where coldwater reliably flows.\nSimilar species The distantly-spaced, bilobed leaves that are attached at their base across the stem help distinguish this species from others that show superficial similarity. Cephalozia species can show small, distantly spaced, transversely inserted lateral leaves like those of Hygrobiella, but they lack the well developed underleaves of the latter. Gymnocolea inflata and Cladopodiella fluitans both have small, distantly arranged bilobed leaves and both likewise can grow on irrigated rock surfaces, but they also lack underleaves and their lateral leaves show dirty brown hues and lack the transparent quality of H. laxifolia. Eremenotus and Cephaloziella have species that are tiny and bilobed that creep along irrigated rock faces, but those too lack prominent underleaves.\nHabitat Moist to wet, often shady mineral soil (esp. gravel), cliffs, boulders, rocky seepage areas, streambanks, and waterfall spray zones in the lowland, montane, and subalpine zones\nAssociated species XXXXXX\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Dec 4, 2025 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

The simple, spreading ovate leaves occur on irregularly-branched shoots up to 2mm wide undergirded by a tangle of dense, colourless rhizoids. Underleaves are lacking, but developing archegonia and antheridia are frequent and can be found on separate plants (“dioicous”). The modified leaves that surround the archegonia (“perianth”) form a characteristic ovoid sheath with a plicate or ribbed apex (see photo).\nSimilar species This is a very generic looking liverwort, but it can be distinguished from other similar species by its habitat, lack of underleaves, rhizoids and reproductive characters. Relatively few species of liverworts have unlobed, simple leaves AND live the semi-aquatic, rock-bound life that J. atrovirens partakes in. Of those, species of Nardia, Chiloscyphus and Odontoschisma have obvious underleaves that can be seen with a hand lens. The remaining lookalikes are all within the group of taxa that have at one time or another been part of the genus Jungermannia. Jungermannia exsertifolia is restricted to subalpine drainage banks and has equidimensional leaves on shoots that are 2.5 mm or wider, whereas shoots of J. atrovirens are less than 2 mm wide and bear leaves that are longer than they are wide. Plectocolea obovata and P. hattoriana are also found on siliceous rocks in streams, but both have bright red-purple rhizoids, whereas those of J. atrovirens are colourless. Solenostoma confertissimum is very similar in size and habitat, but its leaves are about as wide as they are long, whereas J. atrovirens has leaves that are longer than wide. Jungermannia pumila is identical in size, shape and semiaquatic lifestyle, but it grows on siliceous rocks and has antheridia and archegonia on the same individual plants. Jungermania borealis is almost identical in form but with leafy shoots closer to 1 mm (as opposed to 2 mm in J. atrovirens) and an arctic-alpine distribution.\nHabitat Moist to mesic, often calcareous rock outcrops, cliffs, ledges, crevices, boulders, humus, streambanks, heath, tundra, and occasionally decayed wood in the lowland, montane, and subalpine zones\nAssociated species XXXXXX\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Dec 4, 2025 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

See notes under Jungermannia atrovirens, the species to which J. borealis is most similar. The two are very difficult to tell apart in the absence of spores, but the former is larger (leafy shoots wider than 1.5 mm) and occupies more temperate habitats than the latter, which is a small plant (leafy shoots \u003c 1 mm wide) of tundrascapes.\nHabitat Moist, shady rock outcrops, cliffs, ledges, crevices, boulders, and streambanks in the lowland and montane zones\nAssociated species XXXXXX\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Dec 4, 2025 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

The leaves are dark green to black and about as wide (up to 2 mm) as they are long. Rhizoids are pale brown or clear and underleaves are lacking. Antheridia and archegonia occur on separate plants (“dioicous”) and the perianth of leaves surrounding the developing archegonia is plicate near its apex.\nSimilar species On account of its size and dark pallor, J. exsertifolia is unlikely to be mistaken for any other aquatic liverwort in its subalpine habitat. Species of Nardia and Chiloscyphus can be lax and aquatic in subalpine drainage, but they have underleaves that can be made out with a hand lens. Such underleaves are lacking in J. exsertifolia.\nHabitat Moist to wet rock outcrops, cliffs, ledges, crevices, boulders, bogs, streambanks, and waterfall spray zones, occasionally submerged in flowing water, in the lowland, montane, subalpine, and alpine zones\nAssociated species XXXXXX\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Dec 4, 2025 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

The simple, spreading ovate leaves occur on irregularly-branched shoots up to 2mm wide undergirded by a tangle of dense, colourless rhizoids. Underleaves are lacking, but developing archegonia and antheridia are frequent and can be found on different parts of the same plant (“monoicous”). The modified leaves that surround the archegonia (“perianth”) form a characteristic ovoid sheath with a plicate or ribbed apex (see photo).\nSimilar species This is a very generic looking liverwort, but it can be distinguished from other similar species by its habitat, lack of underleaves, rhizoids and reproductive characters. Relatively few species of liverworts have unlobed, simple leaves AND live the semi-aquatic, rock-bound life that J. pumila partakes in. Of those, species of Nardia, Chiloscyphus and Odontoschisma have obvious underleaves that can be seen with a hand lens. The remaining lookalikes are all within the group of taxa that have at one time or another been part of the genus Jungermannia. Jungermannia exsertifolia is restricted to subalpine drainage banks and has equidimensional leaves on shoots that are 2.5 mm or wider, whereas shoots of J. pumila are less than 2 mm wide and bear leaves that are longer than they are wide. Plectocolea obovata and P. hattoriana are also found on siliceous rocks in streams, but both have bright red-purple rhizoids, whereas those of J. pumila are colourless. Solenostoma confertissimum is very similar in size and habitat, but its leaves are about as wide as they are long, whereas J. pumila has leaves that are longer than wide. Jungermannia atrovirens is identical in size, shape and semiaquatic lifestyle, but it grows on calcareous rocks and has antheridia and archegonia on separate plants.\nHabitat Moist to wet, often shady mineral soil, rock outcrops, cliffs, ledges, crevices, boulders, fens, and streambanks in the lowland and montane zones\nAssociated species XXXXXX\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Dec 4, 2025 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

With a hand lens, the 3-4-lobes of each leaf are sharply tipped, converging at a leaf base that diverges from the stem at 90 degrees. In order confidently identify this species, a microscope is neccessary to observe the underleaves, which are typically reduced to 1-2 lobes accompanied by 1-2 amorphous bumps (“slime papillae”– see photograph).\nSimilar species Sorting out species of Kurzia is always going to require high magnification on account of their small size. On account of its small size and tiny, almost filamentous leaf-lobes, K. makinoana can be mistaken for species of Blepharostoma or Lepidozia, both of which can occur in the same habitats. Blepharostoma species have leaf lobes that are 1-cell wide and divided completely to the base of the leaf. In K. makinoana, the lobes are 1-celled at their tip but broaden to 2 (or more) cells towards their base, which is found at about three-quarters down the leaf’s length. Lepidozia species have 3-4 lobed lateral leaves, the leaf itself being divided only to about 1/2 its length into lobes that are 4+ cells wide at their base. Kurzia pauciflora is a species exclusive to open bogs and has 4-lobed underleaves compared to the wider ecological range and 1-2 lobed underleaves of K. makinoana. Distinguishing K. trichoclados requires microscopic examination of the ornamentation of the leaves surrounding the developing reproductive organs.\nHabitat Moist to wet humus, rock outcrops, cliffs, ledges, decayed wood, seepage sites, streambanks, peatlands, bogs, and swamps in the lowland, montane, and subalpine zones\nAssociated species XXXXXX\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Nov 9, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

While its lateral leaves have the genus’ characteristic 3-4 triangular lobes down to about 1/2 their length, they are narrower than the shoot width and very widely spaced along the stems. As the Latin name suggests, this is a plant with an interesting distribution, known predominantly from the Hawaiian Islands and wet-coastal British Columbia.\nSimilar species Because of its large size and shoots growing free from their substrate, it is unlikely to be mistaken for other liverworts with leaves narrower than their stems (eg. species of Cephalozia and Cephaloziella, both of which have 2-lobed leaves). Species of the genus Kurzia have 3-4 lobed leaves as in L. sandvicensis, but they have shoots that only grow to less than 1 cm in length. Amongst the two other regional species of Lepidozia, L. sandvicensis is the only one with leaves narrow than the shoots on which they grow and it lacks the regular and even branching of L. filamentosa as well as the very close arrangement of leaves seen in L. reptans.\nHabitat Moist, usually shady humus, boggy slopes, and streambanks in the lowland zone\nAssociated species XXXXXX\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Nov 9, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

The lateral leaves are attached mostly along the length of the shoot and flipping the shoots over should reveal a narrow, linear underleaf upon close inspection with a hand lens. This species is commonly found with tubular perianths (modified leaves enclosing developing archegonia and sporophytes) that show a recessed beak at their tip (see photo).\nSimilar species There are a number of unlobed leafy liverworts that can occur on rotting wood and thus could easily be mistaken for L. lanceolata. Syzygiella autumnalis has similar colour, leaf size and orientation but lacks the underleaf and recessed beak of the perianth that is present in L. lanceolata. Chiloscyphus species also can look similar, but their underleaves are forked, as opposed to the simple and linear underleaves of L. lanceolata. Species of Jungermannia, Plectocolea and Solenostoma all have simple leaves and similar habits, but none have underleaves and most are not found on decaying wood. Odontoschisma denudata can be found on wet wood, but it has much smaller (shoots less than 2mm wide) and its underleaves are round, not linear. Species of Mylia also have a linear underleaf and unlobed lateral leaves, but leaves at the shoot tip in Mylia are densely crowded into an opposite arrangement while leaves at the shoot tips in L. lanceolata hardly overlap and show obvious staggered arrangement.\nHabitat Moist to mesic, shady humus, decayed wood, and streambanks, especially in coniferous forests, in the lowland and montane zones\nAssociated species XXXXXX\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Dec 4, 2025 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

As implied by the species name, the shallowly bilobed leaves are quite variable along the length of the stem, with some leaves seemingly unlobed, some sharply bilobed and the rest falling somewhere in between. Underleaves are narrowly bilobed and can be seen with a handlens if not obscured by fine hairs.\nSimilar species Species of Lophozia and Lophoziopsis have superficially similair leaves, but leaves in those species are not attached at their base along the long axis of the stem as in L. bidentata, nor do they have underleaves.

Like other members of its genus, L. minor has shallowly-bilobed leaves, but the lobes are rounded and typically covered in globs of asexual spores (“gemmae”) that give the leaf a scuzzy look (see photo). This in combination with the narrow, bilobed underleaf make this species possible to recognize in the field with the aide of a hand lens.\nSimilar species Because of its bilobed leaves, small size and wood-borne lifestyle, L. minor bears some semblance to species of Fuscocephaloziopsis and Lophozia. Lophozia longidens is also a species of decaying wood with asexual spores (“gemmae”) on the leaves, but those spores are typically red and held in clusters at the tips of the leaf lobes. Furthermore, species of Lophozia lack underleaves. L. minor has narrow, bilobed underleaves and its gemmae are light green and arrayed all along the margins of the leaf. Species of Fuscocephaloziopsis are common on rotting wood and have longitudinal leaf insertion, but they lack the gemmae and bilobed underleaves found in L. minor. Within its genus, L. minor is the smallest and has rounded lobes covered in gemmae, while L. heterophylla has leaves that vary in form as you move along the stem, with some unlobed and those that are lobed varying between sharp and rounded lobe tips, all of which lack gemmae. .

It is a complex thalloid liverwort with short, overlapping segments to about 1cm wide and 3 cm long that grow prostrate over fine soils and almost always have semicircular cups on the upper surface that house and disperse asexual spores (“gemmae cups”, see photo). Sporophytes have not been observed in regional material, but in the event that the gemmae cups are absent, attention should be paid to the simple pores on the thallus and the brown colour of the scales on its underside.\nSimilar species When gemmae cups are present, L. cruciata can only be mistaken for Marchantia polymorpha, but in that species the cups are circular, not semicircular or crescent shaped as they are in Lunularia. The weedy habitat is a good clue for plants of L. cruciata that lack gemmae cups, but the simple pores are a good backup feature: the presence of simple pores distinguishes Lunularia from species of Marchantia, which have compound pores, while the presence of brown scales on the underside of L. cruciata seperate it from other complex thalloid genera with simple pores (Mannia, Reboulia, Clevea, Targionia), where the scales are purple or white.\nHabitat Associated species Distribution Map Authors: Last updated: Nov 28, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

The golden-brown, ascending shoots are 3-7 cm long and roughly 4 mm wide. Like other members of its genus, the two unequal and elongate lobes of the leaf unite along a keel towards their base, with the upper lobe about one-half the size of the lower lobe. The upper lobe in this species crosses the entire length of the stem before wrapping around it tightly (see photo) and the tips of both lobes point 90 degrees away from the stem. Confident identification requires mounting of the leaf on a slide so that the presence large leaf papille (see photo) and teeth along the inner margin of the lower lobe can be confirmed.\nSimilar species The elongate, round-tipped and unequal toothy leaf lobes could only be mistaken for species within its own genus or the closely related genera of Scapania and Diplophyllum. Species of Scapania have rounder lobes compared to the elongate lobes of M. microdontium. Diplophyllum taxifolium can be found in arctic and alpine tundra, too, but that species lacks papillae on the leaf cells and has a upper lobe that does not cross the width of the stem. Macrodiplophyllum rubrum is the only other taxon to show this character, but it is a species of wet coastal forests and it, too, lacks papillae on the leaf cells.\nHabitat Moist arctic and alpine tundra\nAssociated species XXXXXX\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Feb 27, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

The horizontal to ascending plants are shiny, yellow brown and show infrequent lateral branching along leaf shoots between 2-6 cm long and 2-5 mm wide. The upper lobe is significantly smaller than the lower lobe, though both have an elongate shape. Up close, the upper lobe is mostly smooth while the variably toothy lower lobe flexes out at around 75 degrees to the stem. If you have the patience or you catch it in an unlikely parched situation, the plant remains mostly uncontored when dry.\nSimilar species While similar in size and leaf aspect to M. rubrum, M. flaccidum lacks its red pigmentation. M. imbricatum is a higher elevation species with smooth leaf lobes that have a rounded aspect. M. flaccidum occurs in similar habitats, but in that species the lower lobes are held at 90 degrees to the stem, whereas in M. plicatum they are held closer to 75 degrees to the stem.\nHabitat Moist, shady humus, mineral soil, rock outcrops, boulders, cliffs, bogs, streambanks, and occasionally tree bases in the lowland, montane, and subalpine zones; frequent in coastal BC.\nAssociated species Distribution Map Authors: Last updated: Feb 27, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

This structure is composed of a long stalk fringed by clusters of white scales both at its base and at the junction with the fruiting head. The carpocephalum lacks linear white scales surrounding the developing black capsule. When sterile, this species can be recognized by the scales on the underside of the thallus that are purple near their base before turning white as they approach the margin (see photo).\nSimilar species Habitat Associated species Distribution Map Authors: Last updated: Jun 17, 2025 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

Up close, the leaves are distantly spaced, symmetrically bilobed, the lobe tips variably sharp or blunt and divided by a V-shaped sinus that descends about 1/4-to-1/3 of the leaf’s length. These plants are “dioicous”, so fertile shoots bearing antheridia are on seperate plants than those that bear archegonia and developing sporophytes.

The leaves are hard to make out without a hand lens and microscopic examination may be required for confident identification. Close inspection shows closely overlapping, bilobed and concave leaves with a moon-shaped (“lunate”) sinus (see photo) that descends to about ¼ of the leaf’s length.\nSimilar species Other thread-like liverworts in its meltwater drainage habitat include species of Anthelia and Cephaloziella. The former differs in having silverish white, deeply dissected leaves, while the bilobed leaves of the latter are very distant and non-overlapping. Marsupella condensata is one of a number of tiny, thread-like species of Gymnomitrion and Marsupella. It is the only small, thread-like Marsupella with the moon-shaped (“lunate”) sinus.

The shoots don’t show much in the way of branching and can be quite variable in size, ranging from .5-2.5 mm wide and 1-5 cm long. The leaves are about as wide as they are long, bilobed (or shallowly notched, depending on your perspective) and have a sinus that descends to about one-quarter of the leaf’s length. The margins of the leaf are curled down (“recurved”) and the leaves as a whole diverge from the stem almost at 90 degree angles.\nSimilar species Species of Anastrophyllum and Sphenolobus can have leaves of similar form and orientation, but in those genera, the leaves are slightly asymmetrical and tend to orient themselves towards one side of the stem, while in M. emarginata, the leaves are symmetrical and face upward. Among the species of Marsupella with wide spreading leaves, M. emarginata is likely to be mistaken only for M. aquatica, M. sphaecelata and M. sparsifolia. M. aquatica grows on rocks around fast flowing water and has been treated as a subspecies, differing in having a shallower sinus (less than 20% of leaf length) and leaves that are visibly wider than long. The predominantly subalpine M. sphacelata and M. sparsifolia have diverging, non-overlapping leaves like M. emarginata, but they also have a burnt purple-blackish colour that immediately distinguishes them.\nHabitat Moist to wet mineral soil, rock outcrops, cliffs, ledges, crevices, boulders, streambanks, and tundra, occasionally submerged in shallow water, in the lowland, montane, subalpine, and alpine zones\nAssociated species Scapania americana, Nardia scalaris, Blindia acuta, Racomitrium aciculare\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Dec 4, 2025 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

The leaves are equally bilobed, the lobes rounded, sinus acute and margins plane. When fertile, antheridia and archegonia are found on separate plants (“dioicous”), not along the same shoot.\nSimilar species There are other dark purple liverworts that can be found around subalpine drainage and on wet rock surfaces, but none of them have the large size and bilobed leaves of M. sphacelata. Jungermannia exsertifolia is large and dark but typically aquatic in subalpine drainage and its leaves are simple, not bilobed as in M. sparsifolia. The similarly scorched M. sparsifolia can grow in the same habitat, but its shoots are smaller (~ 1mm wide) and it has antheridia and archegonia along the same shoots “paraoicous”), not on separate plants (“dioicous”) as they are in M. sphacelata. M. emarginata and M. aquatica can be similar in size, but have paler leaves firmly held at right angles to the stem with margins that curve downwards, whereas the margins in M. sphacelata are plane and are found on leaves that are held laxly.\nHabitat Moist to wet rock outcrops, cliffs, ledges, crevices, boulders, humus, snowbed sites, bogs, peatlands, and tundra in the montane, subalpine, and alpine zones\nAssociated species Harpanthus flotovianus, Scapania undulata, SPhagnum sp.\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Dec 4, 2025 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

Leafy shoots emerge from otherwise creeping, naked stems and are erect, standing about 5 mm tall and less than .5 mm wide. The leaves have plane margins and are attached across the length of the stem, where transparent rhizoids may be found. It is almost always fertile, with antheridia cupped in leaves that subtend the “marsupium”, a large terminal structure that encloses the developing archegonia and sporophytes.\nSimilar species In its montane habitat on rocks and mineral soil adjacent meltwater flushes, there are two other species of Marsupella that might be mistaken for M. sprucei: M. sparsifolia has similar leaf arrangement and form, but has a “scorched” dark purple to black colour, wider shoots (\u003e.5mm) and purple rhizoids, whereas in M. sprucei the leafy shoots are less than half a millimeter wide, brighter, amber in palour and bear clear or whitish rhizoids. M. brevissima is found in similar habitats, but has closely overlapping leaves on horizontal shoots that give the plant a “wormy” look.

The stems have a flattened look to them, their shape often visible between the leaves\nSimilar species Gymnomitrion apiculata is similar in shape and size to M.stableri, but it has more closely overlapping leaves, whereas the leaves of M. stableri have a smaller overlap zone and consequently do not appear as wormy. Marsupella brevissima is found in late snow-bed habitats, typically at higher elevations and has leaves that are clearly free from the stem in the wet state. M. condensata, which can also have wormy shoots, is lighter in colour, has stems that lack the compressed character of M. stableri, and has leaves with moon-shaped (“lunulate”) sinuses.

With a strong hand lens or under a dissecting microscope, you should be able to make out distant, mostly symmetrical leaves that are attached obliquely along the length of the stem, with lobe tips that are rounded and a sinus that descends to no more than 1/4th of the leaf’s length. Under the compound microscope with the iris diaphragm closed, leaves should show the characteristic mound-like papillae on the cuticle as is typical for the genus. Obvious underleaves and gemmae are absent.\nSimilar species The small, thread-like shoots with obliquely inserted bilobed leaves found in M. badensis are most likely to be confused with species of Cephalozia, Fuscocephalozia, Gymnocolea and Cephaloziella. In Cephaloziella, the leaves are attached across the length of the stem in contrast to their oblique attachment along the length of the stem in M. badensis. Species of Cephalozia and Fuscocephalozia can have the same leaf attachments, but their lobe apices are acute, not rounded or obtuse as in M. badensis. Gymnocolea inflata is a larger plant typical of more neutral or acidic habitats, with leafy shoots wider than 1mm whereas the leafy shoots of lime-loving M. badensis are only about .5 mm wide. Within its genus, only M. heterocolpos approaches the small size of M. badensis, but under the microscope, the former species has a smooth leaf cuticle and a well-developed 2-lobed underleaf. M. badensis has papillae on the cuticles of its leaves and the underleaf if present at all is reduced to a few cells. See table for comparison to other regional species of Mesoptychia.\nHabitat Moist to wet, calcareous (limestone) mineral soil, rock outcrops, cliffs, ledges, crevices, boulders, tufa, and streambanks in the montane and subalpine zones; rare in southwest [southern Coast Mts.] and northeast [east of the Rocky Mountains] of British Columbia.\nAssociated species Distribution Map Authors: Last updated: Dec 6, 2025 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

Like all members of the genus, it has a continuous, thin wing of photosynthetic tissue that run along a midrib, but close inspection of the underside reveals pairs of straight hairs along the margins as well as the midrib. You might well see spherical structures under there as well– these are specialized structures that hold the reproductive organs.\nSimilar species Amongst the thalloid bryophytes of the region, it is unlikely to be mistaken for any other genus on account of its small size and thin wings. Species of Riccardia and Fossombronia are of similar size, but the former lacks a midrib and the latter has a ruffled, leafy appearance in contrast to the flattened thallus of M. conjugata. Most other species within the genus Metzgeria can be seperated from it based on features of the hairs. M. americana and M. pubescens have hairs all over both surfaces, while in M. conjugata they are confined to the underside along the margins and midrib. M. leptoneura has a similair arrangement, but in that species, the hairs are curved into a C-shape, not straight. M. temperata can have identical hair arrangement to M. conjugata, but the shoots have tapering tips that are frequently fringed with asexual reproductive bodies (“gemmae”). M. lindbergii is impossible to distinguish without a microscope.\nHabitat Mesic to wet, usually shady rock outcrops, cliffs, boulders, waterfall spray zones, and tree trunks in the lowland zone; frequent in coastal BC.\nAssociated species Distribution Map Authors: Last updated: Feb 27, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

Yanked from their substrate, the shoots are long (up to 3 cm), with the simple, unlobed leaves attaching obliquely to the stem and becoming more distantly spaced as you move down.\nSimilar species This is the only large simple-leaved liverwort that grows exclusively through Sphagnum and has abundant yellow-green gemmae. The presence of prominent simple underleaves seperates it from Cryptocolea, Syzygiella, Jungermannia and Solenostoma. Because of its restriction to bog-like habitats, it could only be mistaken for the much smaller species of Odontoschisma («1 mm wide) or its brethren, Mylia taylorii.

The simple round leaves appear in nearly an opposite arrangement, evenly spaced down the shoot but tightly converging near the tip so as to appear like a set of nested lips. Asexual reproductive bodies (“gemmae”) are frequent and brightly coloured yellow and red, while underleaves are simple and elongate.\nSimilar species In the pantheon of unlobed leafy liverworts, M. taylorii is distinguished from species of Cryptocolea, Syzygiella, Jungermannia and Solenostoma by its prominent underleaf, a feature absent or minute in those genera. Gyrothyra underwoodiana has the same widespreading and subopposite leave arrangement, but its underleaf is two-lobed and the undersides of the stem have recurrent purple patches in contrast to the to M. taylorii where such patches are absent and the underleaves are unlobed. Odontoschisma species can have a similair leaf form and arrangement, but they are usually less than 1 mm wide and 1 cm long and the leaves themselves are very concave. M. taylorii is a much bigger plant and its leaves are plane, not concave. Nardia has shoots that can show the nested lip arrangement of rounded leaves seen in M. taylorii, but it never has gemmae and its underleaf, while similair in shape, is attached to the base of the lateral leaves. In M. taylorii, the underleaves are free from the lateral leaves and gemmae are very common. Mylia taylorii has leaves wider than long with rounded leaf tips topped by bright yellow-red gemmae, while those of M. anomala are longer than wide, with somewhat pointed leaf tips topped by light green gemmae.\nHabitat Moist to wet humus, rock outcrops, boulders, bogs, peatlands, seepage areas, decayed wood, waterfall spray zones, and rarely tree bases in the lowland and montane zones\nAssociated species XXXXXX\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Nov 13, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

The shoots are composed of alternately-arranged elliptical leaves that are broader than long and unlobed (occasionally with two very shallow lobes). On the lower surface of the shoot, an unlobed underleaf should be visible, at least near the tips of the shoot (microscope may be neccessary here). This plant is “paroicous”, meaning that the antheridia are found below the archegonia on the same shoots.\nSimilar species See table for comparison of regional species of Nardia\nHabitat Moist to dry humus, mineral soil, rock outcrops, cliffs, ledges, crevices, boulders, streambanks, and tundra in the upper montane, subalpine, and alpine zones\nAssociated species XXXXXX\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Nov 22, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

The erect shoots with two rows of round, concave and unlobed leaves converging towards a shoot tip typically bedazzled with bright yellow or red gemmae is unique amongst regional leafy liverworts. Up close, you should also be able to make out a simple, round underleaf similair in size and shape to the lateral leaves.\nSimilar species Unlobed leaves in nearly opposite arrangement are found in Jungermannia, Solenostoma, Cryptocolea, Nardia and Mylia, all of which can occur in similar habitats. Of these genera, only Nardia has an underleaf as in O. denudata, but if the former the underleaf is small and narrow, whilst in the latter it is large and round. O. elongatum has a similair leaf arrangement, but the plant is darkly pigmented and lacks gemmae atop its reclined shoots in contrast to the bright hues, erect shoots and apical gemmae of O. denudatum. O. sphagnicola is very similar but lacks gemmae and has pale thread like branches that emerge from the stem that are absent in O. denudatum. Arctic-alpine O. macounii occurs in very different habitat and lacks the pigmentation of O. denudatum.\nHabitat Moist to mesic humus, decayed wood, cliffs, crevices, ledges, peatlands, bogs, tundra, and occasionally tree bases in the lowland, montane, subalpine, and alpine zones\nAssociated species XXXXXX\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Nov 6, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

The rounded, saucer-shaped leaves are arranged suboppositely and point towards the shoot tip. Underleaves are small, triangular and relatively inconspiculous.\nSimilar species Could be mistaken for Syzygiella autumnalis, which occurs in the same habitat but has flat leaves and lacks an underleaf. Other round-leafed species of Odontoschisma are upright and have larger underleaves (O. macounii) or more colourful pigmentation (O. denudata), whereas O. elongatum as reclined shoots with dark pigmentation and barely perceptable underleaves.\nHabitat Moist to mesic humus, cliffs, ledges, crevices, peatlands, swamps, bogs, streambanks, waterfall spray zones, and tundra in the lowland, montane, and subalpine zones.\nAssociated species XXXXXX\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Nov 6, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

Schust. Common NameNone Image Gallery Distinguishing Features Similar Species Habitats Associated Species\nDistribution Map Relevant Literature\nImage Gallery Distinguishing Features Reported from only a handful of low elevation wet sites along the coast, Pellia columbiana is a large simple thalloid liverwort (to 10+ cm long, \u003e 1cm wide) that appears in most respects like the other local species of the genus. Typically a dark, mottled green, it has a thickened vein-like region running down the middle of the thallus that gradulally tapers into the thin, undulating margins that are one cell thick. The diagnostic features of this species are somewhat hard to come by and must be looked for on female plants: when fertile, the ring of tissue surrounding the developing archegonia and sporophytes (“pseudoperianth”) is incised, tattered \u0026 toothed (see image).\nSimilar species Species of Moerckia have large, simple thalli, but are typically adorned with abundant scales on the upper surface. Such scales are absent in Pellia. Calycularia is similair, but has prominent pink-purple scales that can be seen with a hand lens on the underside of the thallus; these are likewise absent in P. columbiana. Apopellia alpicola is a subalpine and alpine species that has a similarly dissected tube surrounding its developing sporophyte, but is unlikely to be found in the same low-elevation environments of P. columbiana.

In the field, it has long shoots (up to 10 cm +) bearing yellow to dark green simply leaves that alternate along the stem, puckering into a rounded fold at their base. Importantly, the tips of these leaves are often without teeth and when teeth are present, they are poorly developed. Confident identification requires microscopic examination of the leaf bases, which run down the stem (“decurrent”) and are made up of homogenous cells.\nSimilar species The simple, decurrent leaves with a rounded fold or pleat near the base makes regional species of Plagiochila unlike any other genus. When lacking teeth on its leaves, P. asplenioides can be distinguished easily from the toothy and similair sized (but far more frequent) P. porelloides. When some teeth are developed along the margin, a microscope is needed to distinguish between the two species.

With shoots up to 8 cm long and 3.5 mm wide, it is amongst the largest liverworts in the region, composed of lateral leaves that look simple and smooth from the top. Turning the shoot over reveals a sac-like lobule on the underside of the leaf as well as conspicuous teeth. The lobule has been shown to have a trapping mechanism with it’s sac-like interior often filled with small invertebrates. As such, it has been interpreted as a “carnivorous” liverwort.\nSimilar species Due to its size and colour, there are few liverworts that could be mistaken for Pleurozia purpurea. Some species of Scapania (S. undulata, S. ornithopodioides, S. uliginosa) can occur in the same habitat and show purple coloration, but all of these have a distinct upper leaf lobe that is smaller than the lower leaf lobe, and both lobes can be seen looking top-down. In Pleurozia, only the larger upper lobe can be seen from the top-down, while the smaller lower lobe takes the form of a sac and can only be seen from the undersides of the shoot.\nHabitat Blanket Bogs\nAssociated species Campylopus atrovirens\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Dec 6, 2025 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

From the underside, the underlobe is narrow relative to the underleaf (see photo). The plants also have a tendency to strongly contort when dry.\nSimilar species When not of sound mind, this could be mistaken for the moss Homalia trichomanoides, but that species lacks underleaves and underlobes. P. cordaeana is darker and freer than light green and appressed Radula. P. cordeana have narrow triangular underlobes compared to the helmet-shaped lobules of Frullania species, which tend to be half the size and suffused with reddish-purple pigments. The matte green colour in combination with the narrow underlobes and tendency to shrivel and contort when dry are easy features to seperate this from other species of Porella.\nHabitat Wet to mesic rock outcrops, boulders, cliffs, tree trunks, and decayed wood in the lowland, steppe, and montane zones; common in coastal and se BC, frequent in sc BC, infrequent in n and c BC.\nAssociated species Distribution Map Authors: Last updated: Feb 27, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

The leaves are best interpretted from the underside, where a large upper lobe can be seen behind a smaller, triangular underlobe that is similar in size and shape to an overlapping underleaf. Male plants have small rattle-like shoots that bear antheridia, while the sporophytes develop from modified, archegonia-bearing leaves on the underside of the main stem of female plants.\nSimilar species Sometimes this species can be confused for a large Radula on account of the tightly overlapping, rounded leaves. Looking at the underside of both plants with a hand lens, you will see that Radula lacks an underleaf. Frullania species are smaller, but absent that, the genus has sphaeroidal, helmet shaped lobules as opposed to the triangular underlobes seen in P. navicularis. The glossy leaves in combination with underlobes that are similair in size and shape distinguish P. navicularis from matte P. cordaeana and similarly-glossy P. roellii, both species with underlobes that are narrower than the underleaves.\nHabitat Moist to dry rock outcrops, boulders, cliffs, cutbanks, tree trunks (esp. deciduous trees), and decayed wood in the lowland and montane zones; common in coastal BC, rare in sc, se, and nw BC.\nAssociated species Distribution Map Authors: Last updated: Feb 27, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

In the wet, organic-rich habitats it seems to thrive in, it grows horizontally and close to its substrate, with numerous branches of the thallus emerging from a jagged main axis like a bolt of bryological lightening.

R. chamedryfolia is much branched and the thallus segments are less than 2 mm wide. Aneura also has a characteristic turpentine smell to the freshly-rubbed thallus that is absent and Riccardia. Amongst other members of its genus, it is most similair to R. multifida on account of its similair branching, but in that species, a wing of thin tissue surrounds the thallus and oil bodies are scant, while in R. chamedryfolia, the thallus is succulent, unwinged and oil bodies are abundant in fresh material.\nHabitat Moist to wet, shady mineral soil, humus, swamps, streambanks, shorelines, and decayed wood, occasionally submerged in shallow water, in the lowland zone\nAssociated species Chiloscyphus polyanthos, Pellia neesiana\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Nov 25, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

The thallus round in profile and barely clears its substrate. Aside from its small size, the plant is distinguished by its sexual condition, whereby archegonia and antheridia are produced on seperate plants (“dioicous”).\nSimilar species On account of its small size, rounded, undifferentiated thallus and linear growth, R. palmata unlikely to be mistaken for any other genus of liverwort in the region. Riccardia chamedryfolia is a much larger plant that exhibits many branches along a jagged main thallus, while in R. palmata, the plant is little branched (once to twice at most).

The thallus has a deep groove (“sulcus”) and away from the margins is a light green. It branches dichotomously 1-3 times. Confident identification may require microscopy to look at size (90-110 um) and ornamentation (winged on the edges, with wormy sculpture on the faces) of the dark brown spores. These can be retrieved from the sporophytes, which are embedded in the thallus tissues along the groove. This species is currently disjunct between California and Southern British Columbia and should be expected somewhere in between.\nSimilar species The orange hue of the thallus margins sets this species apart from all other Riccia in the Pacific Northwest.\nHabitat Seasonally moist fine mineral soil, especially around steeper and rockier seepage sites and ephemeral pools.

Closer inspection reveals a deep and pervasive furrow in the thallus, that, in combination with its unadorned and green underside, makes it relatively easy to recognize when mature. At later stages, the upper surface of the plant begins to degrade and rupture such that the black capsules embedded within the thallus reveal themselves and release their spores.\nSimilar species Ricciocarpos natans, a species of shallow water and its margins, can also exhibit deep furrows across a rosette-forming thallus, but that species has a dark underside marked by elongate black root-like structures. Other species within the genus Riccia have porous upper surfaces (see: R. cavernosa, R. frostii), or are adorned by hairs and scales near the margin of the thallus (R. trichocarpa, R. beyrichiana, R. lamellosa).

When lifted from the water or surface sediments, the dark underside is laden with long, black, root-like tangles, and the upper surface is marked by faint polygons. As the margin of a water body recedes, this species can live out its days on wet mud, often growing upwards of 2-3 cm wide.\nSimilar species Unmistakeable while floating in open water, it is likely to cause a little confusion if found living on sediments or soils where water has stranded it. Riccia sorocarpa is furrowed, too, but lacks the black bottoms and polygonal patterning of the upper surface that is found in Ricciocarpos. Other thalloid liverworts found in similar habitats, such as Marchantia polymorpha and Conocephalum species have more clearly delimited polygons and lack the large black root-like structures on their undersides.\nHabitat Floating on the surface of nutrient- and mineral-rich water in marshes, ponds, ditches, lakeshores, and slow-moving streams, or stranded on shoreline mud, in the lowland, steppe, and montane zones; infrequent east of the Coast-Cascade Mts. and in sw BC.\nAssociated species Riccia frostii, Riccia cavernosa, Physcomitrium patens, Ephemerum serrulatum\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Dec 18, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

The plant is often laden with green, asexual repoductive bodies (“gemmae”) that are two-celled in under the microscope.\nSimilar species The combination of a rounded keel and pointed tip on the lower leaf lobe makes this small species hard to confuse with any other Scapania with the exception of S. apiculata, a plant found exlusively on decaying wood to which S. mucronata is almost macroscopically identical. The upper leaf lobe in S. apiculata is one-half as wide as it is long, while the upper leaf lobe in S. mucronata is roughly greater than two-thirds as wide as it is long. Furthermore, the gemmae, when present and examined under the microscope, are one-celled in the former species and two-celled in the latter.\nHabitat Moist to wet humus, mineral soil, rock outcrops, boulders, cliffs, decayed wood, seepage areas, and streambanks in the lowland and montane zones\nAssociated species Uncertain\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Nov 22, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

The flaccid shoots are little-branched and elongate (to 4 mm wide, 3+ cm long) and vary from green to red to purple and almost black, with the uneven and ellipsoidal leaf lobes becoming tightly appressed to one another near the shoot tip. Leaf lobes can be toothed or untoothed and the upper lobe varies from about 1/3rd to 2/3rds the length of the lower lobe, the two lobes converging along a sharp fold (“keel”) that is about 1/3 the length of the lower lobe.\nSimilar species Scapania uliginosa and S. paludicola can be found in similair wet habitats, but both of those species have an arched keel, while the keel in S. undulata lacks the dramatic arch. Because it is a highly variable species in terms of color and the presence and absence of teeth, care should be taken to note the attachment of the upper and lower lobes to the stem. The upper lobe attaches directly across the stem (“non-decurrent”) while the lower lobe attachment runs down the length of the stem (“decurrent”). When teeth are present, these attachments help distinguish it from Scapania americana, which has an upper lobe that is decurrent. S. subalpina and S. obscura have similair lobe attachments and smooth margins, but their upper lobes are »3/4 the size of their lower lobes, whilst in S. undulata, the upper lobe is \u003c 2/3rds the size of the lower lobe.\nHabitat Moist to wet mineral soil, rock outcrops, boulders, cliffs, streambanks, waterfall spray zones, bogs, and seepage sites, often submerged in shallow water, in the lowland, montane, and subalpine zones\nAssociated species Pellia neesiana, Racomitrium aciculare, Marsupella emarginata\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Nov 21, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

The development, size and number of the teeth seems to vary depending on habitat, with nearly toothless forms occuring at high elevations and often treated as Schistochilopsis opacifolia or S. incisa subsp. opacifolia.\nSimilar species No other species of leafy liverwort is green, lobed, toothed and succulent. Species of Barbilophozia can be lobed with teeth on the lobe tips, but none in between as in Schistochilopsis incisa, nor are the leaves in Barbilophozia succulent. Fossombronia species have lettuce-like leaves but they are thin and lack the spines of S. incisa.\nHabitat Moist, shady decayed wood, humus, rock outcrops, boulders, cliffs, cutbanks, seepage sites, bogs, snowbed sites, heath, and tundra in the lowland, montane, subalpine, and alpine zones\nAssociated species Cephalozia bicuspidata, Scapania sp., Lophozia sp.\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Nov 22, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

Shoot tips often narrow and attenuate. Gemmae occasionally present (reddish-brown to green) in clusters at tips of attenuate shoots\nSimilar species Similar to several other species/genera with thread-like shoots and concave, bilobed leaves. Under a microscope, it can be immediately separated from all of these by the uniformly thick cell walls and, especially, the concentric rows of quadrate to rectangular cells emanating from the leaf lobe tips (other species with irregularly placed, usually rounded cells). Macroscopically, it may be confused with Barbilophozia sudetica, but is distinguished by the placement of leaves around the stem rather than often primarily on one side (i.e., secund). Differs from Sphenolobus saxicola, a rare species of far northwestern BC, in its smaller size (shoots 0.4-1.5 mm wide, vs. 1.2-3 mm wide in S. saxicola), slightly smaller leaves (0.4-0.7 mm, vs. 0.5-0.8 mm in S. saxicola), and occasional presence of gemmae (always lacking in S. saxicola). Anastrophyllum assimile is also similar to S. minutum, but is a darker blackish to blackish-brown colour and the dorsal lobe of the leaves is slightly decurrent along the stem.\nHabitat Wide variety of wet to mesic, open to shaded habitats, but most frequent on acidic rocks, cliffs, and ledges; also terrestrial in subalpine heath, on peaty slopes, or on hummocks in bogs. Occasionally on decaying wood or tree bases.\nAssociated species Barbilophozia hatcheri, Schljakovia kunzeana, Schljakovianthus quadrilobus, Dicranum spp., Cephalozia bicuspidata, Gymnomitrion obtusum, Mylia taylorii, Sphagnum spp., Ptilidium ciliare, Scapania americana, Tritomaria quinquedentata\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Oct 12, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.
