The thallus can grow between 2-5 cm long and 2-6 mm wide, having a characteristic greasy texture when its fresh tissues are rubbed. The thallus, though thickest in the center (10-to-20 cells thick), lacks an obvious midrib and tapers gradually towards its margins (1-to-3 cells thick). Under the microscope, oil bodies are colourless and abundant (6-to-20 per cell). The male and female plants are seperate; sporophytes, when present, emerge from the underside of the plant.\nSimilar species Because of its amorphous and thick thallus, A. pinguis could be mistaken for many other bryophytes. It has a thallus not dissimilair to the hornworts Anthoceros and Phaeoceros, but those two genera have thalli that form brached rosettes and bear pyrenoids in their cells, large photosynthetic apparati that are absent in the mostly linear thalli of Aneura. Species of Pellia are similar in form, but have a more pronounced midrib and lack the turpentine smell of fresh Aneura. It should also be noted that sporophytes are produced along the upper surface in the former but emerge from the underside of the thallus in the latter. Species or Riccardia are narrower (thallus segments \u003c 2 mm wide) and their surficial cells have fewer oil bodies.\nHabitat Moist to wet mineral soil, humus, bogs, fens, swamps, peatlands, streambanks, shorelines, decayed logs, seepage areas, cliffs, boulders, rock outcrops, ledges, waterfall spray zones, and disturbed areas in the lowland, montane, and subalpine zones;\nAssociated species Sphagnum sp.\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Nov 25, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

Bazzania denudata has 3-4 lobes on its underleaf, however, while species of Calypogeia have 2 at most.

With a hand lends the leaves are composed of four equal and linear lobes that are seperated all the way to the very base of the leaf. Under the microscope, these lobes are only one cell wide.\nSimilar species Species of Kurzia are of similair size with 4-lobed leaves and can occur in similair habitats. The leave lobes in that genus, however, are 1-celled at their tip but broaden to 2 (or more) cells wide towards their base, which is found at about three-quarters down the leaf’s length. In B. trichophylla, the leaf lobes are always 1 cell wide and are divided all the way to the very base of the left. Differences with Blepharostoma arachnoideum are subtle– the latter tending to have 2-3 lobes that often branch further along their length, while in B. trichophyllum, there are typically 4 (sometimes 3) lobes that are never branched. B. trichophylla is often treated as a complex of closely related taxa with intergrading morphologies.\nHabitat Moist to wet, usually shady humus, rock outcrops, boulders, cliffs, ledges, decayed wood, streambanks, and waterfall spray zones in the lowland, montane, and subalpine zones\nAssociated species XXXXXX\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Nov 13, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

Typically tightly appressed to decaying conifers and organic-rich soils, this species can be confirmed by hand lens examination of the underleaf, which should show two lobes that are divided to about half of their length. Like many species in the genus, C. muelleriana frequently has gemmae-bearing shoots that have more distant leaves and erect shoot apices with light-green clusters of asexual spores.\nSimilar species Calypogeia muelleriana is unlikely to be confused with any other genus of leafy liverworts with the exception of Bazzania, which can show similair shingle-like arrangement of leaves. That genus, however, has leaves that have tooth-like notches at the tips and underleaves with more than two lobes. The green, rounded leaves and evenly two-lobed underleaves of C. muelleriana are similair to many species in the genus Calypogeia, but can be distinguished from other species with a hand lens. Plants of C. azurea have identical leaves and underleaves, but have a blue hue, while C. sphagnicola has leaves that are triangular in shape and do not overlap, whereas leaves in C. muelleriana are round and tightly overlap. C. integristipula and C. neesiana have unlobed underleaves and C. fissa has an underleaf dissected almost all the way to its base, while the underleaf in C. muelleriana is only dissected to about half of its length. C. suecica, a rare species of wet wood, is very small (typically \u003c1 mm wide) and has somewhat pointed underleaves relative to the rounded underleaves of C. muelleriana, which occur on shoots typically \u003e2 mm wide.\nHabitat Decaying wood and organic rich soil banks in forests\nAssociated species Lepidozia reptans, Bazzania denudata, Tetraphis pellucidam Pseudotaxiphyllum elegans\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: June 17, 2025 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

The tips of the lateral leaves are rounded or blunt, occasionally with a shallow and round notch, while the underleaves are very narrow but discernably two-lobed with a hand lens. When fertile, this species has archegonia and antheridia on seperate plants; species recognition here requires observation of the leaves surrounding the archegonium, which should be similair in form to the lateral leaves. Alternately, you can look to make sure that there are typically 2 oil bodies per leaf cell.\nSimilar species The longitudinal attachment of blunt, simple leaves in habitats that often host water winnows the list of liverworts for which this could be confused. Gyrothyra underwoodiana is a species of wet banks with similair leaves and leaf attchment, but its undersides have a characteristic set of discrete purple “pads” that are absent in Chiloscyphus pallescens. Species of Jungermannia and Solenostoma have simple leaves, but they are attached at a more oblique angle and both genera lack the underleaves of Chiloscyphus. Species of Plagiochila can have similair oblique-longitudinal attachment of unlobed leaves, but those leaves typically have teeth and the plants never have an underleaf. C. pallescens has an underleaf and its leaves are unadorned. Lophocolea heterophylla typically has leaves showing variable degrees of lobing along the length of the stem, but when the leaves are unlobed, they can look like Chiloscyphus, but C. pallescens does not show much variation in leaf form along the stem. Chiloscyphus polyanthos has leaves and stems that are morphologically indistinguishable from C. pallescens. Close inspection of the leaves surrounding the archegonia in fertile material should show smooth leaf margins in the former and teeth on the latter, while microscopic examination will show most leaf cells of C. polyanthos have 2 oil bodies, while those of C. pallescens mostly have more than 2 oil bodies.\nHabitat Moist to wet humus, mineral soil, rock outcrops, boulders, cliffs, decayed wood, streambanks, waterfall spray zones, and seepage sites, often submerged in shallow water, in the lowland, montane, and subalpine zones\nAssociated species XXXXXX\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Nov 12, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

It tends to thrive in perpetually seeping or wet environments, where it luxuriates as elongate, scrambling irregularly-branched, snakeskin-like thallus segments to 10+ cm long and more than 1 cm wide. Up close, the pores of the thallus are simple and the air chambers are visibly delimited as convex diamonds. Archegonia and sporophyte-bearing carpocephala, when present, take 18 months to develop in to towering structures that can exceed 10 cm tall at the tips of female plants, while the antheridia are produced in sessile clusters on seperate male plants.\nSimilar species Habitat Associated species Distribution Map Authors: Last updated: Nov 26, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

Confident identification requires microscopy to count the number of cells across the leafs’ width (12-25) and note the even thickness of terminal lobe cells.\nSimilar species Species of Cephaloziella can occur in peaty habitats, but they have leaves narrower than the stems they are borne on, whilst in F. pleniceps, the leaves are wider than the stems. In the family Cephaloziaceae, only F. connivens and F. lunulifolia exhibit leaves that attach down the length of the stem as in F. pleniceps. F. connivens tends to have lobe tips that converge on one another like a crab’s pincher, whereas those of F. pleniceps seldomly converge and tend to point upwards. F. lunulifolia is very similar to F. pleniceps, but under the microscope it has outer walls of the terminal lobe cells much thicker than the inner wall, whilst in the latter the wall is evenly thickened all around.\nHabitat XXXXXX\nAssociated species XXXXXX\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Nov 6, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

The lateral leaves are shallowly-lobed (less than 1/4 the leaf’s length), their tips sharp but triangular, while the underleaves are clearly visible with a hand lens and are also clearly two-lobed. When sporophytes are present, they emerge anomalously along the underside of the shoot.\nSimilar species Most likely to be confused with species of Lophozia, Mesoptychia and Lophocolea, all of which can show variations of shallowly but acutely two-lobed leaves inserted along the length of the stem. Species of Lophozia lack the underleaves of Geocalyx. Underleaves are present but obscure in Mesoptychia and when visible are simple and narrow, not two-pronged and visible with a hand lens as in Geocalyx. Lophocolea bidentata has nearly identical underleaves, but in that species, the lobe apices are very fine and long, while those of Geocalyx are triangular and truncate.\nHabitat Moist to mesic, usually shady humus, mineral soil, decayed wood, tree trunks, rock outcrops, ledges, crevices, cliffs, and streambanks in the lowland and montane zones alpine zones\nAssociated species XXXXXX\nDistribution Map Authors: Last updated: Nov 12, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

On account of its small size and tiny, almost filamentous leaf-lobes, K. makinoana can be mistaken for species of Blepharostoma or Lepidozia, both of which can occur in the same habitats. Blepharostoma species have leaf lobes that are 1-cell wide and divided completely to the base of the leaf. In K. makinoana, the lobes are 1-celled at their tip but broaden to 2 (or more) cells towards their base, which is found at about three-quarters down the leaf’s length. Lepidozia species have 3-4 lobed lateral leaves, the leaf itself being divided only to about 1/2 its length into lobes that are 4+ cells wide at their base. Kurzia pauciflora is a species exclusive to open bogs and has 4-lobed underleaves compared to the wider ecological range and 1-2 lobed underleaves of K. makinoana.

Like other members of its genus, L. minor has shallowly-bilobed leaves, but the lobes are rounded and typically covered in globs of asexual spores (“gemmae”) that give the leaf a scuzzy look (see photo). This in combination with the narrow, bilobed underleaf make this species possible to recognize in the field with the aide of a hand lens.\nSimilar species Because of its bilobed leaves, small size and wood-borne lifestyle, L. minor bears some semblance to species of Fuscocephaloziopsis and Lophozia. Lophozia longidens is also a species of decaying wood with asexual spores (“gemmae”) on the leaves, but those spores are typically red and held in clusters at the tips of the leaf lobes. Furthermore, species of Lophozia lack underleaves. L. minor has narrow, bilobed underleaves and its gemmae are light green and arrayed all along the margins of the leaf. Species of Fuscocephaloziopsis are common on rotting wood and have longitudinal leaf insertion, but they lack the gemmae and bilobed underleaves found in L. minor. Within its genus, L. minor is the smallest and has rounded lobes covered in gemmae, while L. heterophylla has leaves that vary in form as you move along the stem, with some unlobed and those that are lobed varying between sharp and rounded lobe tips, all of which lack gemmae. .

FrequencyLocally weed Image Gallery Distinguishing Features Similar Species Habitats Associated Species Distribution Map Relevant Literature Image Gallery © John Reynolds Lunularia cruciata photo 1 © John Reynolds Lunularia cruciata photo 2 © Nathan Earley Lunularia cruciata photo 3 Distinguishing Features Lunularia cruciata is a weedy species typical of garden margins that reaches the limits of its tolerance in south coastal British Columbia. It is a complex thalloid liverwort with short, overlapping segments to about 1cm wide and 3 cm long that grow prostrate over fine soils and almost always have semicircular cups on the upper surface that house and disperse asexual spores (“gemmae cups”, see photo). Sporophytes have not been observed in regional material, but in the event that the gemmae cups are absent, attention should be paid to the simple pores on the thallus and the brown colour of the scales on its underside.\nSimilar species When gemmae cups are present, L. cruciata can only be mistaken for Marchantia polymorpha, but in that species the cups are circular, not semicircular or crescent shaped as they are in Lunularia. The weedy habitat is a good clue for plants of L. cruciata that lack gemmae cups, but the simple pores are a good backup feature: the presence of simple pores distinguishes Lunularia from species of Marchantia, which have compound pores, while the presence of brown scales on the underside of L. cruciata seperate it from other complex thalloid genera with simple pores (Mannia, Reboulia, Clevea, Targionia), where the scales are purple or white.\nHabitat Associated species Distribution Map Authors: Last updated: Nov 28, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

Like all members of the genus, it has a continuous, thin wing of photosynthetic tissue that run along a midrib, but close inspection of the underside reveals pairs of straight hairs along the margins as well as the midrib. You might well see spherical structures under there as well– these are specialized structures that hold the reproductive organs.\nSimilar species Amongst the thalloid bryophytes of the region, it is unlikely to be mistaken for any other genus on account of its small size and thin wings. Species of Riccardia and Fossombronia are of similar size, but the former lacks a midrib and the latter has a ruffled, leafy appearance in contrast to the flattened thallus of M. conjugata. Most other species within the genus Metzgeria can be seperated from it based on features of the hairs. M. americana and M. pubescens have hairs all over both surfaces, while in M. conjugata they are confined to the underside along the margins and midrib. M. leptoneura has a similair arrangement, but in that species, the hairs are curved into a C-shape, not straight. M. temperata can have identical hair arrangement to M. conjugata, but the shoots have tapering tips that are frequently fringed with asexual reproductive bodies (“gemmae”). M. lindbergii is impossible to distinguish without a microscope.\nHabitat Mesic to wet, usually shady rock outcrops, cliffs, boulders, waterfall spray zones, and tree trunks in the lowland zone; frequent in coastal BC.\nAssociated species Distribution Map Authors: Last updated: Feb 27, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

Gyrothyra underwoodiana has the same widespreading and subopposite leave arrangement, but its underleaf is two-lobed and the undersides of the stem have recurrent purple patches in contrast to the to M. taylorii where such patches are absent and the underleaves are unlobed. Odontoschisma species can have a similair leaf form and arrangement, but they are usually less than 1 mm wide and 1 cm long and the leaves themselves are very concave. M. taylorii is a much bigger plant and its leaves are plane, not concave.

Typically a dark, mottled green, it has a thickened vein-like region running down the middle of the thallus that gradulally tapers into the thin, undulating margins that are one cell thick. The diagnostic features of this species are somewhat hard to come by and must be looked for on female plants: when fertile, the ring of tissue surrounding the developing archegonia and sporophytes (“pseudoperianth”) is incised, tattered \u0026 toothed (see image).\nSimilar species Species of Moerckia have large, simple thalli, but are typically adorned with abundant scales on the upper surface. Such scales are absent in Pellia. Calycularia is similair, but has prominent pink-purple scales that can be seen with a hand lens on the underside of the thallus; these are likewise absent in P. columbiana.

The leaves are best interpretted from the underside, where a large upper lobe can be seen behind a smaller, triangular underlobe that is similar in size and shape to an overlapping underleaf. Male plants have small rattle-like shoots that bear antheridia, while the sporophytes develop from modified, archegonia-bearing leaves on the underside of the main stem of female plants.\nSimilar species Sometimes this species can be confused for a large Radula on account of the tightly overlapping, rounded leaves. Looking at the underside of both plants with a hand lens, you will see that Radula lacks an underleaf. Frullania species are smaller, but absent that, the genus has sphaeroidal, helmet shaped lobules as opposed to the triangular underlobes seen in P. navicularis. The glossy leaves in combination with underlobes that are similair in size and shape distinguish P. navicularis from matte P. cordaeana and similarly-glossy P. roellii, both species with underlobes that are narrower than the underleaves.\nHabitat Moist to dry rock outcrops, boulders, cliffs, cutbanks, tree trunks (esp. deciduous trees), and decayed wood in the lowland and montane zones; common in coastal BC, rare in sc, se, and nw BC.\nAssociated species Distribution Map Authors: Last updated: Feb 27, 2024 Relevant Literature Godfrey, J.D.

Shoot tips often narrow and attenuate. Gemmae occasionally present (reddish-brown to green) in clusters at tips of attenuate shoots\nSimilar species Similar to several other species/genera with thread-like shoots and concave, bilobed leaves. Under a microscope, it can be immediately separated from all of these by the uniformly thick cell walls and, especially, the concentric rows of quadrate to rectangular cells emanating from the leaf lobe tips (other species with irregularly placed, usually rounded cells). Macroscopically, it may be confused with Barbilophozia sudetica, but is distinguished by the placement of leaves around the stem rather than often primarily on one side (i.e., secund). Differs from Sphenolobus saxicola, a rare species of far northwestern BC, in its smaller size (shoots 0.4-1.5 mm wide, vs. 1.2-3 mm wide in S. saxicola), slightly smaller leaves (0.4-0.7 mm, vs. 0.5-0.8 mm in S. saxicola), and occasional presence of gemmae (always lacking in S. saxicola). Anastrophyllum assimile is also similar to S. minutum, but is a darker blackish to blackish-brown colour and the dorsal lobe of the leaves is slightly decurrent along the stem.\nHabitat Wide variety of wet to mesic, open to shaded habitats, but most frequent on acidic rocks, cliffs, and ledges; also terrestrial in subalpine heath, on peaty slopes, or on hummocks in bogs.
