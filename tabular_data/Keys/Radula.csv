1b,Lobule on leaf underside crossing less than half the width of the stem. Cortical and medullary cells of stem similar,2,,
2a,"Microphyllous branches present; trigones of dorsal leaf lobes large, distinct",R. prolifera,/radula/prolifera.jpg,"Arnell, 1913"
2b,Microphyllous branches absent; trigones of dorsal leaf lobes absent or weakly- to moderately-developed,3,,
3a,"Cells of dorsal leaf lobes uniformly thin-walled, trigones absent; rhizoids absent; stems usually producing an abundance of small, spreading branches (one per leaf) that give the shoots a plume-like habit",R. obtusiloba,/radula/plume.jpeg,Randal Mindell

4a,"Dorsal leaf lobes ovate to obovate, apices bluntly angular to rounded, inner margins adnate to stem, mid-leaf cells ca. 15-20 μm; ventral leaf lobes inflated, rhomboidal-ovate, ca. 1/2 -1/3x the length of the dorsal lobes; plants dioicous",R. bolanderi,/radula/radbol.jpeg,Randal Mindell
